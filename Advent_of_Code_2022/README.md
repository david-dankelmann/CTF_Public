#Advent of code 2022

To learn C++ i participated on the [Advent of Code Challenges in 2022]: https://adventofcode.com/

Mostly i started off programming a working PoC in Python in order to translate this solution into C++ afterwards. 

I did this for educational reasons, no intentions to compete for leaderboard here.
